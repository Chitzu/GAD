# Python GoogleAtelier course repository

It contains basic Python data structures, the game "Spanzuratoarea", a working Calculator, "web scraping" with Selenium and a web app using Django.

In the web app made with Django you can add, activate and modify the list of locations from the associated database. I have implemented a check-in, a functional Log In page, the addition of new accounts. Also I have developed the process of resetting the password and sending a message after resetting it.
